# Totally Not Suspicious Core Mod

This is the core mod for the Totally Not Suspicious (TNS) Minecraft server. It contains a number of server-specific features, tweaks, and more. This is a replacement of the old [Seasonal Datapack](https://github.com/TotallyNotSuspiciousMC/seasonal-data/) with the goal of packaging those changes into a single, more powerful, and more performant mod.

## Key Features for Season 13 

This is my current TODO list.

- [x] A custom map powered by [NovoAtlas](https://github.com/TheDeathlyCow/novoatlas).
- [x] Nations structure, a not-quite-factions system designed to enhance player interactivity on the server.
- [x] Recipe changes, as usual.
- [ ] Automatic loading of experimental datapacks (Villager Trade Rebalance)
- [ ] Anvil XP change
- [ ] Custom Advancements for fun
- [ ] Custom loot tables
